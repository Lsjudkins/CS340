How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future? 

To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using code commenting which also keeps the code organized. Project One was based on clarity by creating the CRUD Python code in which it broke down the create, read, update, and delete in small sections. Project Two was based on execution and connecting Project One to obtain the end goal. The CRUD Python module could be used in the future to create software that is easy to maintain. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests? 

As a computer scientist in order to apprach a problem you have to understand the problem. I approach the database or dashboard requirements by executing the code step by step and cross out requirements as I complete them. I engaged in tutoring sessions for this project because I was overwhelmed with the not knowing why my code kept returning error after the error. The techniques that I will used in the future to create databases to meet other client request is to prioritize my work load.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better? 

Computer scientist study applications, algorithms, and systems of computer technology. My work on this type of project will help Grazioso Salvare organize their data better and provide a visualized representation of the data so that the information is easier to understand.
